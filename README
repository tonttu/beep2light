beep2light converts terminal beeps into flashes of Thinklight (keyboard light
in Thinkpad laptops). The program is a fork of script -program from
util-linux/misc-utils -package, see copyright notes from beep2light.c or
COPYING.

beep2light can be used for example with irssi: Thinklight flashes when
somebody says your name etc.
